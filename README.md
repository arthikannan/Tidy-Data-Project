﻿﻿﻿# Tidy-Data-ProjectGetting and Cleaning Data - week 4 Project**run_analysis.R** file contains the code for the _tidy data set_ and the _tidy dataset2_. File _avg___data.txt_ is the output dataset of average of all variables by activity and subject.- The _tidy dataset_ contains the data merged from training and test dataset.- The training dataset is arrived by merging the data from _subject__train, _x__train and _y__train.- The test dataset is arrived by merging the data from _subject__test, _x__test and _y__test.- The _tidy dataset2_ contains the average of all variables by activity and subject.The steps involved in arriving at the tidy dataset are:- Reading the X__train file- Reading the features list and assigning it as column names of X__train- Reading y__train (activity list) and assigning it as a factor variable with the activity label- Reading subject__train and renaming col name to subject__id and assigning as factor variable- Merging Training dataset- Reading the X__test file- Assigning features as column names of X__test- Reading y__test (activity list) and assigning it as a factor variable with the activity labels - Reading subject__test and renaming col name to subject__id and assigning as factor variable- Merging Testing dataset- Merging Training and Testing Dataset- Extracting measurements of mean and std- Average of each variable with subject _id and activity- Writing tidy dataset
